A somewhat casual encounter with a bunch of mercenaries led us down a dingy hole of twisty passages, all rotating in the opposite direction. Thanks to the Black Knife Mercenary Company, we now own two of those pink gems, a bunch of lapis lazulis, a swimming cap, some strange orbs and ointments. Add to this the decapitated head of a half giant, Gwinny's new obsession with hands, a new manoeuvre we're calling, "The Wookie Doo" and it's just another day in the life of Bards! Bards! Bards!

Did I mention we totally rocked it at the 7 Canarys Inn gig? So much so we've got 4 more booked and this doesn't even include the Fire Spyre one! W000t!
