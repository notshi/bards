The effect quickly dissipated as soon as Gwinny reached out to slice his throat. It all seemed far too easy. Still, her covert operation remained intact as they swiftly exchanged words about some rotten trout and meat served at yesterday&#39;s lunch.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<img src=\"/data/dnd170116_1.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n<span class=\"caption\">Dave reunited with his god awful golden drums</span>\n\n<p>Desperate to stop the ultimate Channel Divinity gig that was looming in the horizon, Gwinny left the manor short of clues but arms filled with muttering masks and a magnificent golden drum set.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>During which Leon was busy harassing the real Benito in the dark alley way to no avail, Dave was setting up a protest showing with me helping out. Down with that sort of thing and all that.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Later we reconvened at Aeropose&#39;s and requested he set us up a bomb. The Hyperfast Mining Thing was suggested, mostly as he doesn&#39;t like it underneath his shop. The plan was for me to use my boots of choir to fly over the stage and use Mage Hand to place and detonate the Hyperfast Mining Thing whilst we were all very much out of sight.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>The only condition Aeropose had was that <b>no one</b> was to get hurt. Easier said that done but we agreed.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Pretty soon, a small mushroom cloud appeared over what used to be the stage for Channel Divinity&#39;s ultimate gig and 3 unlucky occultists were blamed for the deed when they were caught suspecting each other under hushed tones at the local pub.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>To rejoice, we initiated an impromptu gig with our biggest fan who showed up for the protest. Leon worked the crowd like the fabulous manager we know and love, everyone was chanting, &quot;Bards! Bards! Bards!&quot; as we belted our latest and greatest to the tune of Channel Divinity shaking their fists from Lord Pendeghast&#39;s house.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>There was also the perform-off with Abrigand which lasted about an hour. Just an infinite solo loop alternating between him and Gwinny. Abrigand won with one note over but it was pretty clear Bards! Bards! Bards! was the true winner.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"song_wrap\">\n    <b>Song List:</b> \n    <div class=\"song\">\n        <span>Hey!

Something about whispers of the damned or voices of the insanity, can&#39;t remember the details but see, when we returned to his place, he got all uppity and left us this melodramatic letter and a list of ingredients. Good thing we took the letter with us after a look around cause when we left the fancy house, it disappears!\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>So then we looked around and did some shopping to get the items on Ozaridur&#39;s list, most of which could be found in town apart from the poisonous Ricatra leaves which Leon procured from the Thieves&#39; Guild of which he now owes a favour.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Did I mention the time Leon sneaked into Lord Pendeghast&#39;s home to defecate in Abrigand&#39;s chest of costumes? Well, now I have.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Apparently, the poor sods who paid money to see the band were being hypnotised during Maelion&#39;s violin solo. What are they like? A bit sad really to do all that to get people to like you.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<img src=\"/data/dnd160815_1.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n<span class=\"caption\">A kobold lair full of nasty little kobolds</span>\n\n<p>Anyway, next thing we know, we were surrounded by kobolds and Gwinny almost gets killed by Leon&#39;s stabby ways. The kobolds, also known as geckos with hands or scaly dog people were tricky dickbags but they were soon silenced with our swords.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Later, we found ourselves in another Channel Divinity gig where we noticed that Maelion&#39;s violin was covered in the symbol of Sehanin, God of Illusion and Trickery and the Moon. We spoke to the magistrate about this who adviced us to talk to the magical types in Goldenvale. We headed to Aeropose to build us a counter-sound machine, an apparatus  with high enough frequency, it should disrupt the dratted violin solo!</p>\n</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"peak_wrap\"><div class=\"peak\"></div></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"date\"><a href=\"/blog/2015-08-16-log-08\">~ Strumm, 2015-08-16</a></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"bards\"></div>\n</div>\n\n",

Any adventurer in the right mind would start exploring, maybe there&#39;s a bob or two hidden around. Next thing you know, our eight-legged friend came to life and leaped out of the painting! Good thing Gwinny erased its legs. Before you know it, Leon stabbed the prone creature to death and everyone&#39;s a happy camper. \n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<img src=\"/data/dnd190715_1.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n<span class=\"caption\">All hail the natural 20</span>\n\n<p>Then there was the &quot;floating ring on a pedestal&quot; room which infuriated all of us on the account of it being puzzling and everything. There was this silver surfer person you see; Bob was his name, wouldn&#39;t let us go near the thing. We tried reasoning with him but he wasn&#39;t having it. Then we met 3 unrelentless masks in another room being totally unhelpful with the ring situation.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, Bob was totally boss but with a few spells, he shattered into enough silver glitter to fill up a squirrel bag and the ring, now in our possession, turned out to be magical and had this spell storing cast on it. Tidy!\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>So like, we finally go through the portal and turns out we&#39;ve been gone for 6 whole weeks! But you know, we saved 600 water elves so that probably counts as something. Sadly, people thought we were dead and all our fans mourned us by being total fans of Channel Divinity. Talk about ungrateful.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Tanalia Embalg, the magistrate gave us our own all inclusive house with a nice big safe in the kitchen. Being professional musicians, we soundproofed the walls and made a dungeon for safe exit across the river. We bought horses and named them Dingaling (Strumm), BattleBob (Leon), Nessie (Dave) and Xybraxis the Defiler (Gwinny). It was a grand old time.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Oh and Gwinny finally got her Dulcimer fitted with the fires of Hell, thanks to the crazy stunt we pulled to steal the Taurimbulator for Aeropose to mod it with. That crazy genius! Speaking of crazy, Gwinny seems not quite right ever since she wielded that thing. Maybe it&#39;s just me but her eyes say otherwise. Those eyes.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>In any case, for some reason, we found ourselves ambushed by a bunch of orcs after Leon fought the champion, Braff - a wee one in leather shorts armed with an axe, just so that we could have an audience with the orc chief.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<img src=\"/data/dnd190715_2.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n<span class=\"caption\">\"For the chained one!\" - Orcs ambush!</span>\n\n<p>Turns out, the chief was innocent and something was amiss in the orc camp!</p>\n<div class=\"song_wrap\">\n    <b>Song List:</b> \n    <div class=\"song\">\n        <span>Go home, spider!

This sudden turn of events quickly set a couple of things in motion, namely a new song, &quot;The only king here is Entropy&quot; hastily written down by Gwinny whilst the rest of the group awkwardly shifts around the dodgy exchange between the band manager and his new focus of interest (<i>the Ganasi lady</i>). Hopefully we get a gig venue out of this.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>And behold, we actually did perform an impromptu performance some mere moments later. A free one, of course; we&#39;re not barbarians. Also we were feeling generous. Also, because it was all subterfuge to get some nasty looking fish people to stop beating up the water elves. Gwinny was super inspired and started singing another new song, &quot;It&#39;s Sushi Time!&quot; which I&#39;m sure will be a total hit. This super inspiration must be infectious. The next thing you know, Dave starts throwing his drum sticks into the air, crossbows a fish to death, catches the sticks in mid-air and starts drumming again. Way too cool.

So much so, we had to draw our own map lest we get lost!\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<img src=\"/data/dnd210615_2.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>\n<span class=\"caption\">Super Awesome Map by Gwinny</span>\n\n<p>On the plus side, we met a totally cool Beholder Spectator who let us in on some excellent treasure after we sang him yet another song, &quot;Quit your fucking job, it sucks.&quot; I think it&#39;s safe to say he&#39;s now a fan of &quot;<b>Bards! Bards! Bards!</b>&quot;. We also recorded some decoy messages on this incredible machine (<i>Gwinny drew a picture of this so we can show it to that inventor to recreate</i>), received some blessings of inspiration from Ayoon (<i>apart from Dave who insists we were exchanging parts of our memory for this</i>) and then there was this really annoying silver surfer creature who wouldn&#39;t let us touch the tablet with pink gems due to us not being Azalabron (<i>some angel in service of Ayoon</i>) even after Gwinny pretended to be him, wings and all. The nerve!\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Oh, and Leon finally used that scroll on himself. I think he saw the apocalypse or something cause I&#39;ve never seen such fear in his eyes. And nothing fazes Leon. Nothing.\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"song_wrap\">\n    <b>Song List:</b> \n    <div class=\"song\">\n        <span>The only king here is Entropy</span>\n        <span>It's Sushi Time!</span>\n        <span>Quit your fucking job, it sucks.</span>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"peak_wrap\"><div class=\"peak\"></div></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"date\"><a href=\"/blog/2015-06-21-log-06\">~ Strumm, 2015-06-21</a></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"bards\"></div>\n</div>\n\n",
