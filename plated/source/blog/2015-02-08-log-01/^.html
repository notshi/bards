Poncy gig for the nobles down the mines at Ulder. 100 gold, she said. Leon promises a huge crowd, banners and everything. Guinevere keeps giving autographs away. At this rate, no one's going to pay for them in the future. Met a gnome. Says he crafts things and we should give him a visit if we came across any machines down there. Long story short - killed a bunch of skeletons, freed a miner, saw some golems fending an army of undead. Oh and we ended the day by slaying not 1, but 3 massive hellhounds. Thanks, Mage Hand.
