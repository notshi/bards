It's been 2 whole years since we've gotten this band together to set off on this meandering adventure. Nothing could have prepared us for the events that were to unfold before our very eyes.


After the incredulous Drummer Dave's secret-dwarven-time-travelling affair, and not to mention, his new found appreciation of self-erected statues, we were more than happy to jump into the offered portal to our initial intended holiday destination. It's been so long since we've had some time off, who knew saving lives were so much effort.


Anyway, so we did just that - only to be transported to the wrong city where every single denizen was brainwashed to serve our heads on a silver platter to none other than that drasted band, Channel Divinity!


What does a bard have to do to get some alone time around here?! Do these people not have lives?
