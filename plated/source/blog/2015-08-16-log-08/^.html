When the signal of a flaming arrow was seen shooting across the sky, we found ourselves in Hermit Wood, fighting side by side the orcs against an army of bad people lead by a tall and lanky sickly-skinned human drenched in greasy, dark hair.

As we charged towards the camp with our horde of orcs, it was plain to see that the baddies were probably outnumbered and soon, with bolts of lightning everywhere, each enemy fell to their death and the battle was over.

The tents were mostly filled with food and common armour supply with the exception of one which housed maps of the region, a big pile of papers and a small chest of gold and random materials. From here, we found that the pink gems are actually eyes and the uncovered ones are all in the material plane and no where else.

Oh yeah, we also met up with this fancy wizard dude in his fancy house at the end of the village to get an anti-scrying spell for the pink gems. Something about whispers of the damned or voices of the insanity, can't remember the details but see, when we returned to his place, he got all uppity and left us this melodramatic letter and a list of ingredients. Good thing we took the letter with us after a look around cause when we left the fancy house, it disappears!


So then we looked around and did some shopping to get the items on Ozaridur's list, most of which could be found in town apart from the poisonous Ricatra leaves which Leon procured from the Thieves' Guild of which he now owes a favour.


Did I mention the time Leon sneaked into Lord Pendeghast's home to defecate in Abrigand's chest of costumes? Well, now I have.


Apparently, the poor sods who paid money to see the band were being hypnotised during Maelion's violin solo. What are they like? A bit sad really to do all that to get people to like you.

Anyway, next thing we know, we were surrounded by kobolds and Gwinny almost gets killed by Leon's stabby ways. The kobolds, also known as geckos with hands or scaly dog people were tricky dickbags but they were soon silenced with our swords.


Later, we found ourselves in another Channel Divinity gig where we noticed that Maelion's violin was covered in the symbol of Sehanin, God of Illusion and Trickery and the Moon. We spoke to the magistrate about this who adviced us to talk to the magical types in Goldenvale. We headed to Aeropose to build us a counter-sound machine, an apparatus  with high enough frequency, it should disrupt the dratted violin solo!
