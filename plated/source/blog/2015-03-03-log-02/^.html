Dear Channel Divinity,
We're not mad. In fact, we're glad. More than glad that you're performing for Lord Pendeghast.


We're here for the people, you see. The people that we save from the evils of this world; the same people that will rejoice in the music of, "Bards! Bards! Bards!".


We're here to stay. To slay. And get paid.


You'll see.


And by see, we mean, to look with both eyes. Because that's what we have on you. Both, if not all of our eyes set on you, dear Channel Divinity.


Much love,
B.B.B.


<i>ps: Hey Abrigand! We can totally smell you from all the way here at Odd's Hollow. And that's really bad cause the village is on fire.</i>
