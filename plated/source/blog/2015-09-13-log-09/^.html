Another day, another battle. Except this time we were joined by our dear inventor friend, Aeropose.

When a beam of crackling energy flew towards the Water portal to be turned into Fire, a polygonal stone with runes carved into it appeared to Gwinny and a voice made itself heard in her head, "Would you like more Power? More Fire to kill your enemies?" One wonders what her reply was for she did not say it out loud. One also wonders how one was able to know if this happened, if at all.


Soon, a green jolt of light shot out of the portal and fleshy things with teeth grew out from beneath the ground. Huge tentacles and monsters surrounded us, hungry for action.

It took a while but before you know it, Aeropose was hitting the machine with a wrench, the tentacle was deaded and we were shopping for a leather jacket, a horned red gem, exploding bolts, smoke bombs, a prank device and an immovable rod at the Grand Bazaar of the Fire plane.
